# Binary Search on Graphs as a framework for Interactive Learning

Forked repo containing Python code for the post ["Binary Search on Graphs"](https://jeremykun.com/?p=20322).

As the name suggests, it's an implementation of a Binary Search algorithm applied to graphs: as a user, if you run the code, you get to play a game where you chose a vertex in a graph and the algorithm tries to guess which one it is: you provide feedback and you get new guesses in a sequential and interactive fashion, until the guess is the right vertex.

The .pdf file is the report of my project work for the course in Statistical Methods for Machine Learning, taught by ["Nicolo' Cesa Bianchi"](http://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/) at the MSc in Computer Science, University of Milan.
It contains an introduction to the theory behind this research topic and an explanation on why it's interesting.
